## Explanation Framework

### For Code
1. **High-Level Purpose**
   - What is this code doing?
   - Why does it exist?

2. **Key Components**
   - What are the main parts?
   - How do they work together?
   - What algorithms or patterns are used?

3. **Data Flow**
   - What data flows through?
   - How is it transformed?
   - What are the inputs/outputs?

4. **Edge Cases**
   - What special cases exist?
   - How are errors handled?
   - What assumptions does it make?

5. **Implementation Details**
   - Why this approach?
   - Trade-offs considered?
   - Alternatives?

### For Concepts
1. **Definition**
   - What is it?
   - When would you use it?

2. **Core Principles**
   - What makes it work?
   - Key ideas?

3. **Examples**
   - Real-world usage
   - Code examples

4. **Common Mistakes**
   - What people get wrong
   - How to avoid them

5. **Relationship to Other Concepts**
   - How does it relate to X?
   - When would you choose this over that?

## Usage
