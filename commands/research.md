Research: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Research Workflow

1. **Clarify Scope**
   - Define the question, target audience, and constraints
   - Identify time horizon and depth required

2. **Plan the Investigation**
   - List key sub-questions
   - Identify source types (docs, papers, benchmarks, case studies)

3. **Gather Evidence**
   - Prioritize authoritative sources
   - Capture citations and dates
   - Note contradictions and uncertainty

4. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Separate facts from interpretation
   - Summarize trade-offs and implications
   - Provide confidence levels

5. **Deliver Output**
   - Use the Research Report Template
   - Include sources and open questions

## Output Template

Use: `docs/templates/research-report.md`

## Usage

- `/research "best approaches to realtime data sync"`
- `/research "compare Redis vs Kafka for event streaming"`
